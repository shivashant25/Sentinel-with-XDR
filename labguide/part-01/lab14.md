1. Once validation is ok, click **Create**. Note that the deployment process takes **about 15 minutes**, in part because we want to make sure all the ingested data is ready for you to use once finished.

On the home page you should see some ingested data and several recent incidents. Don't worry if you don't see the incidents initially as in the screenshot below, they might take a few minutes to be raised.
