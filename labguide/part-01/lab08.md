## Lab 08 - Ingest Logs from Azure Network security Groups

## Lab scenario

A network security group contains security rules that allow or deny inbound network traffic to, or outbound network traffic from, several types of Azure resources. In this lab, you configure the integration of Network security group logs with a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system to enable thorough security monitoring and analysis.

## Lab objectives (Duration: 45 minutes)
In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:
- Task 1: Ingesting logs from Azure Network security Groups to Sentinel

6. Click on **Install**.

1. Now you need to setup a analytics rule to get alerts as a incident in the Sentinel. Click on **Analytics** and search for *Azure Network Security Group* under *Rule templates* select and **Create rule**.
   
1. Click on **Automated response** then **Review + create** and click on **Save**. This will create an alert rule.
   
1. Now you will be able to see the incidents generated by the Azure Network Security Group in **incidents** tab once you setup an alert rule.
   >**Note**: It will take time to generate.
