## Lab 03 - Deploy Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

## Lab scenario

You are a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that is implementing Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Your manager plans to onboard a few devices to provide insight into required changes to the Security Operations (SecOps) team response procedures.

You start by initializing the Defender for the Endpoint environment. Next, you onboard the initial devices for your deployment by running the onboarding script on the devices. You configure security for the environment. Lastly, you create Device groups and assign the appropriate devices.

>**Important:**  The lab Virtual Machines are used through different modules. SAVE your virtual machines. If you exit the lab without saving, you will be required to re-run some configurations again.

## Lab objectives (Duration: 60 minutes)
In this lab, you will perform the following:
- Task 1: Preparing the Microsoft Defender workspace
- Task 2: Initialize Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Task 3: Onboard a Device
- Task 4: Configure Roles
- Task 5: Configure Device Groups

### Task 1: Preparing the Microsoft Defender workspace

1. On the **Microsoft Defender** portal(https://security.microsoft.com/), from the navigation menu, select **Settings** from the left.

1. On the **Settings** page select **Microsoft Defender**. You are going to see an image of a coffee mug and a message that reads: *Hang on! We're preparing new spaces for your data and connecting them.*. It will take several minutes to finish, so leave the page open but make sure it finishes since it is required for the next Lab. 

    >**Note:** If you get the error message "We didn't plan it will fail, but something went wrong." retry the step later or do it before the next Lab.

1. When the new space completes successfully, you are going to see the Microsoft Defender settings for Account, Email notifications, Preview features and Streaming API.

### Task 2: Initialize Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

In this task, you will perform the initialization of the Microsoft Defender for the Endpoint portal.

1. If you are not already at the Microsoft Defender portal, start the Microsoft Edge browser.

1. In the Edge browser, go to the Microsoft Defender portal at (https://security.microsoft.com).

1. In the **Sign in** dialog box, copy and paste Email/Username: <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject> and then select Next.

1. In the **Enter password** dialog box, copy and paste Password: <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject> and then select **Sign in**.

1. On the **Microsoft Defender** portal, from the navigation menu, select **Settings** from the left.

1. On the **Settings** page select **Device discovery**.
